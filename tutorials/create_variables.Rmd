```{r}
# load the mtcars data
data(mtcars)
```

```{r}
head(mtcars) # Look at the first 6 rows of your data 
```
<br />    

**Create a constant** 
```{r}
# we can create a constant that is always '1' 
mtcars$constant <- 1 
head(mtcars)
```
<br />    

**Create a variable from existing variables** 
```{r}
# Ratio of horse power to cylinders
mtcars$hp_c <- mtcars$hp/mtcars$cyl
head(mtcars)
```
<br />    

**Create a variable based on the values of existing variables** 
```{r}
# dummy variable to indicate if a car gets more than 20 mpg
# use the "ifelse" command
# ifelse(condition, if meets condition give variable this value, otherwise give variable this value)
mtcars$mpg20 <- ifelse(mtcars$mpg > 20, 1, 0)
head(mtcars)
```
